## Overview

Meta Box Updater is an extra tool that helps you automatically update the Meta Box extensions installed on your WordPress website. Without this extension, you won't get the latest versions from Meta Box and thus, the installed extensions might be buggy and incompatible with latest version of WordPress.

After installing Meta Box Updater, you'll see new version notifications in the WordPress admin, just like this:

![wordpress plugin update notification](https://i2.wp.com/metabox.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/meta-box-updater-new.png)

And you're able to update them seamlessly just like plugins on wordpress.org.

For more information, please see the [extension page](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-updater/).
