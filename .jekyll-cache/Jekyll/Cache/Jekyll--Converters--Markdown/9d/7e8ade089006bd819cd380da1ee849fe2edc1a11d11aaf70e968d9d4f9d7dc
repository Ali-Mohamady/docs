I"(<p>We have 3 extensions that can help you control the visibility of a meta box for a certain post/page:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-include-exclude/">Meta Box Include Exclude</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-show-hide/">Meta Box Show Hide</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-conditional-logic/">Meta Box Conditional Logic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That might be confused as you donâ€™t know which extension is the right choice for you. So the main difference between them is the following: <strong>Meta Box Include Exclude</strong> hides meta boxes <strong>by PHP</strong>, meaning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meta boxes are removed completely from the editing screen, no HTML markup is outputted at all</li>
  <li>Since meta boxes are removed completely, there are no inputs at all and thus, there are no meta values are saved at all</li>
  <li>There is no way to show the meta boxes again unless reloading the page</li>
</ul>

<p>Both <strong>Meta Box Conditional Logic</strong> and <strong>Show Hide</strong> hide meta boxes <strong>by Javascript</strong>, meaning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The HTML of meta boxes are outputted, inputs are only hidden and the meta values are submitted when saving post and are saved in the database</li>
  <li>You can show them without reloading the page</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Meta Box Conditional Logic</strong> differs from <a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-conditional-logic/">Show Hide</a>: it has <strong>more advanced options</strong> which allows you to show/hide not only meta boxes but also fields and specific HTML elements. The Show/Hide extension can show/hide only meta boxes. Besides, the number of conditions in Conditional Logic are more than Show/Hide extension (greater, less than, not equal, etc.).</p>
