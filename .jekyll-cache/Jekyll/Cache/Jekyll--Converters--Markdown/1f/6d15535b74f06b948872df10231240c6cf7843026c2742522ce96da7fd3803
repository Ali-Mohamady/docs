I"`<p>To ensure the user input is safe to save to the database, Meta Box provides a mechanism to sanitize fields’ values. The sanitization is automatically applied for all built-in field types. For some fields such as select or radio, Meta Box also validates the submitted value to ensure it’s a valid value (e.g. available in the field options).</p>
