I"Œ<p>All <a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/">premium extensions</a> for the Meta Box plugin can be updated automatically or manually. The automatic update uses WordPress update mechanism which checks for new versions twice a day. This is the recommended way to get new updates from our website.</p>

<h2 id="automatic-update">Automatic update</h2>

<p>To enable automatic update, you need to have a valid license key. Go to <a href="https://metabox.io/my-account/">My Account</a> page to get it. Of course, you have to buy at least one premium extension to have the license key.</p>

<p>Then go to <em>Dash Board &gt; Meta Box &gt; License</em> and enter your license key and click <strong>Save Changes</strong> button. Make sure you paste the correct API you just copied above. (If you see message <em>Invalid license key</em>, please try again one more time).</p>

<p>From now on, when WordPress checks new versions for plugins, it will also check for new versions of Meta Box extensions. If there is any new update, youâ€™ll see this:</p>

<p>Then you can update the extensions the same way as for other plugins by clicking <strong>update now</strong> link.</p>

<h2 id="manual-update">Manual update</h2>

<p>You can also update the extensions manually by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://metabox.io/my-account/">My Account</a> page.</li>
  <li>In your account page, you will see all downloads for your purchased extensions. Download the extension(s) to your computer, unzip the file and upload the extension folder to your website, overwriting the old files.</li>
</ol>
